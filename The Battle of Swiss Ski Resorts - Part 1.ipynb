    "Switzerland has numerous ski resorts, all of which have their own advantages. However, not all ski resorts have the same venues. In particular, if you want to spend your holiday in a nearby village, you need to consider which venues you would like to benefit from. Some villages offer wellness facilities, others focus more on culture, and still others offer a wide range of restaurants. "
